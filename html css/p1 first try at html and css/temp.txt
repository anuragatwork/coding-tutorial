so i am doing a little experiment, and amidst the experiment there is no chickening out. 
so basically i'll blindly follow the practise project without really understanding the concepts and syntax
just mimicking the project and in the next 5 projects i'll google every thing after each project and see
whats best for learning

          before we embark on our journey to find " what is happiness", i have a
          quick question for you. when you were really angry the last time, were
          you asking yourself "am i finally angry now ? ". i bet you didn't .
          thats because such is the very nature of feelings they are byproduct
          of something else. it and itself their search's quest is futile.
