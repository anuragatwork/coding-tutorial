          <h2>a quick question ?</h2>
          <p>
            Before we embark on our journey to find <b>" what is happiness"</b>,
            i have a quick question for you. when you were really angry the last
            time, were you asking yourself "am i finally angry now ? ". i bet
            you didn't . Thats because such is the very nature of feelings they
            are byproduct of something else.
            <b>In and itself their search's quest is futile.</b>
